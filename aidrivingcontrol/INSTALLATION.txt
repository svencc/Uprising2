AI DRIVING CONTROL - SCRIPT VERSION INSTALLATION GUIDE
======================================================

1) Extract folder AIDRIVINGCONTROL to your mission root folder.

2) Insert or create this lines on DESCRIPTION.EXT:

	class cfgFunctions{
		//AI Driving Control (script version)
		#include "aidrivingcontrol\cfgfunctions.hpp"
	};

	class CfgRemoteExec{
		//AI Driving Control (script version)
		#include "aidrivingcontrol\cfgremoteexec.hpp"
	};

3) Insert or create this lines on INITSERVER.SQF:

	//AI Driving Control (script version)
	null = execVM "aidrivingcontrol\init.sqf";

3.1) Insert or create this lines on INITPLAYERLOCAL.SQF:

	//AI Driving Control (script version)
	if !(isServer) then{
		null = execVM "aidrivingcontrol\init.sqf";
	};

4) Spawned vehicles:

	To initiate script on spawned vehicle(s) execute this once (server or client):

	<vehicle> remoteExec ["AIDC_fnc_init"];

	Also accepts arrays:
	[<vehicle1>,<vehicle2>,...] remoteExec ["AIDC_fnc_init"];

	Also may be used to add handleDamage EH (no damage) to spawned gates:
	<gate> remoteExec ["AIDC_fnc_init"];
	[<gate1>,<gate2>,...] remoteExec ["AIDC_fnc_init"];

	Or combine both vehicles and gates:
	[<gate1>,<vehicle2>,<gate2>,<vehicle1>,...] remoteExec ["AIDC_fnc_init"];

=============================================================================================================================

Zeus vehicles and gates are initiated automatically once steps 1), 2), 3) and 3.1) are executed. Usable by all clients's AI.

Vehicles and gates spawned (spawned != zeus) on different machines will be usable by all clients's AI if step 4) is executed.
